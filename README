A set of scripts to go from AVL to 3D CAD

only works with meters. if you don't like it, scale it after...

currently requires Octave or MatLab, and SolidWorks

right now it works for solidworks, i'm certain it could be extended to other CAD packages

the AVL parsing is very brittle

sample 'supergee.avl' included. I modded it a bit from drela's original so that it would work with my (crappy) parser.

the list of things that aren't implemented is vast, but here's a couple of the worst ones:

surface scaling
surface angles (only section angles supported now)
better dihedral (all sections of a surface are rotated to line up with the "average" angle of the surface)
default airfoil, perhaps. right now if no AFILE, no bueno


enough jabbering, how to use it:

run "avl_to_SW('supergee.avl','filename');" in octave or matlab (only tested in octave)
this will generate a series of "filename1.txt, filename2.txt..." files, one for each section and body in the avl file.

in solidworks, to go tool->macro->run

and select curvegen3.swp

this will spawn a dialogue box, select the first of the generated files ("filename1.txt" in this case)

each section will be brought into two 3d sketches, one of a spline through the points of the airfoil, and one of just the points.

have a blast!

rotor/blade scripts coming soon
